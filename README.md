# Logo

The purpose of this project was to practice drawing with Core Graphics. This project was a lot of fun, and I was able to solidify my understanding of Core Graphics and creating custom UIViews. Originally, I was going to make a [Lambda logo](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5cd091cfb5499f22bdf72905/5cd0922159aa32213d6fd7d4_lambda-newlogo.png), as our project wanted us to, but after looking through [this page](https://dribbble.com/search?q=logo) for a bit, I decided I wanted something more challenging so I settled on the [BMW logo](http://www.car-brand-names.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BMW-logo.png).

Because the BMW logo is really circular, I ended up needed to figure out how to draw semi-circles: something we hadn't went over at all in class.

Another challenge I wanted to try before the end of the day was to draw a custom button by subclassing `UIButton`. I ended up doing something simple and making a triangle button before finishing for the day.
